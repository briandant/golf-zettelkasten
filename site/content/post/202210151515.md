# podcast with sasho mackenzie, the golf improvement podcast 

- he has many published papers on putting 
- most putts are not missed because bad contact (for a decent player)
- and the same is true for stroke path 
- face angle matters
- green reading matters
- speed matters
- tour pro makes straight 8 footer 100% of time (indoors) but only 50% of time on the course
- we don't see enough unique putts in practice
- 4–6 feet matter, then 6–12 feet, then less the longer putts
- so target these putts (and hit unique putts from these distances)
- the practice session should be 12 minutes
- do comparision with green reading styles
