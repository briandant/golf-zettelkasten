> Carbon steel is a steel **with carbon content from about 0.05 up to 2.1 percent by weight**. The definition of carbon steel from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) states:

> - no minimum content is specified or required for chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, or any other element to be added to obtain a desired alloying effect;
> - the specified minimum for copper does not exceed 0.40%;
> - or the maximum content specified for any of the following elements does not exceed the percentages noted: manganese 1.65 per cent; silicon 0.60 per cent; copper 0.60 per cent.

> **The term carbon steel may also be used in reference to steel which is not stainless steel**; in this use carbon steel may include alloy steels. High carbon steel has many different uses such as milling machines, cutting tools (such as chisels) and high strength wires. These applications require a much finer microstructure, which improves the toughness.
