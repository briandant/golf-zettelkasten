> RESULTS: Six females with a mean age of 23 years participated in the pilot data reported here (3 in the PP group; 3 in the WT group). Based on non-parametric paired testing no differences existed between PP and WT for the pre-test push up test (PP-28: WT-23, p=0.8). On the post-test no statistically significant differences existed in the PP group (p=0.6). In the WT group statistically significant differences existed for the push up test (p=0.005).

> CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that subjects in both groups saw increases in upper-body strength with statistically significant differences between pre and post testing in the WT group. As data collection continues more differences may become apparent. One plausible reason for the WT group demonstrating differences is likely due to an outlier in the PP group.

it's a small study, "pilot data," but it shows that there were no gains in muscle mass with using the power plate
