> In a study conducted in 2007, 99 PGA Tour Players were asked to each strike a number of 13 foot long putts on medium to slow greens. Many different aspects of their strokes were measured. I'll only cite four here, in the table below. For each, I've recorded the average and standard deviation (the standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of the values).

>                       Group Average 	Group Dispersion
Backswing Time (BST) 	670 ms 	        90 ms
Backswing Length (BSL) 	241 mm 	        38 mm
Time to Impact (TI) 	317 ms 	        35 ms
Impact Speed 	        1510 mm/s       119 mm/s

> Another interesting characteristic is that **the ratio is the same for all length putts** (except very long ones which require a very long stroke). For instance, if one compares a 6 foot putt to a 20 foot putt, the 20 foot putt has a longer backstroke, more putter speed at impact, a longer follow through, but the time of the stroke (tempo and ratio of 2 to 1) is the same as a 6 foot putt.
 
> I encourage you to start experimenting with your own putting stroke. To achieve the 2:1 ratio, **I use a count of 1-2-3-4**. **On 1, I start my backstroke; on 2-3, I complete my backstroke and begin my forward stroke; on 4, the putter blade hits the ball**. You'll need to figure out the pace which feels best to you. I'll have some recommendations in future newsletters.
