> **Robotic testing proves . . . regardless of the brand . . . traditional "tour design" wedges like the ones in your bag right now have a more finicky sweet spot than even the most traditional forged blade irons!**

> And because of this revolutionary approach to wedge design, the Edison Forged wedges beat every ‘tour design’ wedge on the market by delivering up to 24% better smash factor on those higher face and toe misses that creep in all to often. [That means your mis-hits end up much more like your best shots in trajectory and distance.]
